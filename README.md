# Android-orgs

### What is this project?

Orgs is a basic app that lists products with images, titles, descriptions and prices. I made it with the support of the [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/android-kotlin-personalize-app) android course.

### What technologies did i used?

I used mainly the Android framework with kotlin, constraintLayout to build most screens and Coil library to load images with URLs.

### Why this tech?

* [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) : because coil's API leverages Kotlin's language features for simplicity and minimal boilerplate.
